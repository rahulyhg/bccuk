						 	<h1>About</h1>
						    <p><img src="images/bccuk.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="BCCUK" style=" float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0; width: 40%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #660000;"> The Buddhist Community Centre UK is a nascent organisation with a mission to establish a Monastery, with an adjacent Community Centre, in the South East Region. </p><p>We are in the process of establishing, The Buddhist Community Centre UK. This will be a centre for all Buddhists and will be open to members of the public with an interest in Buddhism.</p>
						    <p>
							<p>The temple will ideally have a community hall adjacent to it where individuals can gather after ritual practices to celebrate the occasion. We are on the look out for a hall that will accommodate over 500 people whenever pujas or functions are held.</p>

							<h3>Patron</h2>
							<p>
The dedication, motivation and hard work of the management committee are beginning to pay dividends as we are already in the process of receiving funds/donations for this project. That said, it is still a far cry from the actual estimated cost of building /establishing a Monastery. Recently, we had the backings for this project from the world renowned British Mountaineer, Sir Chris Bonington, CBE. Chris, as I am sure you will be aware, has led a number of mountaineering teams to the Himalayas, and four expeditions to Mount Everest alone. As you can see there is an exciting time ahead of us and we would like your support with this project.</p>

							<h3>Location</h3>
							<p>Several locations have been considered but the most convenient seems to be the areas within the counties of Hampshire or Surrey. Support: The centre will be supported by a number of dedicated volunteers and funded by individuals or group donations.</p>

							<h3>Bookstore</h3>
							<p>There will be a bookstore where we stern readers will have access to Buddha's teachings at whatever level they wish to practice. Although the books will be based on the ancient Buddhist Teaching, they will be accessible and there will be facilities to translate them into all modern languages. Swayambhunath, Kathmandu Buddha's wisdom can help you develop inner peace, find happiness and make your life meaningful.</p>

							<h3>The Seven Principles of Public Life</h3>
							<p>The Committee has set out 'Seven Principles of Public Life' which it believes should apply to all in the public service. These are:</p>

							<ul class="list-group">
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>1. Selflessness</strong> <p>Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.</p></li>
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. Integrity</strong> <p>Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.</p></li>
							  
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Objectivity</strong> <p>In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit.</p></li>
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Accountability</strong> <p>Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.</p></li>
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>5. Openness</strong> <p>Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.</p></li>
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>6. Honesty</strong> <p>Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.</p></li>
							  <li class="list-group-item"><strong>7. Leadership</strong> <p>Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.</p></li>
